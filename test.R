#q1:- what is variable in r programing?
  storing the data in values.
#q2:-what are strings and what are the char write some example's for each of them?
  the elements which is denoted between in double quotes in r example:-"jaysree"
  char converts a numerics object to a string data 
#q3 what are vectors create a vectors of range 20?
  a vector is a collection of numbers, arithemetic expressions, Logical values or character strings for example:-a<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)
#q4 what are numeric in r-programming?
   it represents both whole and floating-points numbers
#q5 write some examples on numeric and create a variable NUM?
   example:-(123),(32.43),(-2,3)
#q6 what are integers explain it with some examples
   a whole number that can be positive, negative or zero example:- 5L,1,-3,6.
#q7 what are (>),(<),(^)these symbols and how are they used
   
#q8 what are vectors, integers, numeric, char explain it with 3 examples each?
   vectors are the collection of numbers, arithmetical expressions eg:- c(1,2,-3,4,5)
   integers are the whole numbers which are positive,negative eg:-(5L,2L,6,8)
   numeric are the numbers represents whole amd floating point.eg:-(13),(5,6),(-9)
   char is to convert a numeric object in to a string type data.
#q9 how to create a file in r programming,write it's steps?
